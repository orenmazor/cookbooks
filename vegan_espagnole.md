vegan espagnole

1. sweat your mirepoix
2. make a roux out of flour and a flavourless oil (grapeseed is good)
3. add the roux slowly to the veggies and sautee until uniform and lightly coloured
4. add tomato paste or red miso paste if you're a fancy pants
5. add hot mushroom stock in thirds while whisking like your life depends on it. NO CLUMPS
6. bring up to a boil and add aromatics (garlic, bay leaves, parsley whatever you want)
7. reduce to a simmer and bring it down to a half volume or your prefered texture
8. strain out all solids
